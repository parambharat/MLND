<p>Some Slack tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can write single-line code in a message by wrapping it in backticks ` , and multi-line code with three, like this ```</li>
<li>Snippets, which can be created by hitting the plus sign on the left, are for large code blocks</li>
<li>Make sure to set your notifications, slack allows great customization, you can set notifications by specific words, and by specific channels.</li>
<li>You can <code>@mention</code> someone and it will notify them.  Please do not use the <code>@channel</code> notification.</li>
</ul>
