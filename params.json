This document is meant to act as a comprehensive tour of our team, so you can jump right in with everyone right away.\r\n\r\nPlease have a look at our [community guidelines](https://github.com/machinelearningnanodegree/MLND/wiki/Community-Guidelines) when you have a chance.\r\nAlso have a look at the [tips and tricks](https://github.com/machinelearningnanodegree/MLND/wiki/Tips-and-Tricks) compiled by previous students.\r\n\r\nThe Team Admins are:\r\n- Devon (@geekman2)\r\n- Nash (@nash)\r\n- Bharat (@param.bharat)\r\n- Gilad (@giladgressel)\r\n- Joshua (@joshuacook)\r\n- David (@dtimm)\r\n\r\nPlease understand we are students just like you! \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, comments or concerns about Slack team, or just about how something works feel free to ping us either individually or in `#to_admin`, one of us is active almost 24/7\r\n\r\nSome Slack tips:\r\n- You can write single-line code in a message by wrapping it in backticks \\` , and multi-line code with three, like this \\```\r\n- Snippets, which can be created by hitting the plus sign on the left, are for large code blocks\r\n- Make sure to set your notifications, slack allows great customization, you can set notifications by specific words, and by specific channels.\r\n- You can `@mention` someone and it will notify them.  Please do not use the `@channel` notification.\r\n\r\n[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1leih0E5mq0tpgKHClgChv-Hr0Xm0sitW25gzuc1VCdY/edit?usp=drivesdk) are some cool machine learning ideas that anyone can pick up. And once you've decided, add it to [our list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KI8Wf0eaoNCzVd7r1MkQb5hg5rbMTXm5kNdwCh1l7Yc/edit#gid=0).",
